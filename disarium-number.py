'''
Definition

Disarium number is the number that The sum of its digits powered with their respective positions is equal to the number itself.
Task

Given a number, Find if it is Disarium or not .
Warm-up (Highly recommended)
Playing With Numbers Series
Notes

    Number passed is always Positive .
    Return the result as String

Input >> Output Examples

disariumNumber(89) ==> return "Disarium !!"

Explanation:

    Since , 81 + 92 = 89 , thus output is "Disarium !!"

disariumNumber(564) ==> return "Not !!"

Explanation:

Since , 51 + 62 + 43 = 105 != 546 , thus output is "Not !!"

# This was the best practice - using enumerate..

# There is a problem using the index function, because if there are duplicated numbers the index function will return the lowest indext number meaning a number later in the list will be powered by a lower index position.

# Not sure what a disarium number is from the explaination, will need to do some research. Disarium number is not in wikipedia.

# These Dont Work - fixed by not using index() as power

# Test.assert_equals(disarium_number(2427), "Disarium !!")
# This does not work - because the actual text is wrong - trying it again on codewars and the code above worked
